# Code Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please see the [Xenia Contribution Guide](https://developers.xenia.com/contribute/getting-started/) which describes the process for making code contributions across Xenia projects and [join our "Native Mobile Apps" community channel](https://pre-release.xenia.com/core/channels/native-mobile-apps) to ask questions from community members and the Xenia core team.

When you submit a pull request, it goes through a [code review process outlined here](https://developers.xenia.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review/).
